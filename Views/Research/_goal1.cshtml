            Extreme poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement,
            one in five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.25 a day, and there are millions more who make
            little more than this daily amount, plus many people risk slipping back into poverty.

        <p>
            Poverty is more than the lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood.
            Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services,
            social discrimination and exclusion as well as the lack of participation in decision-making.
            Economic growth must be inclusive to provide sustainable jobs and promote equality.
