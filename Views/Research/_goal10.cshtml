        Reduced inequality within and among countries

        <p>The international community has made significant strides towards lifting people out of poverty.  The most vulnerable nations – the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction.  However, inequality still persists and large disparities remain in access to health and education services and other assets.</p>
        <p>Additionally, while income inequality between countries may have been reduced, inequality within countries has risen. There is growing consensus that economic growth is not sufﬁcient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive and if it does not involve the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental.</p>
        <p>To reduce inequality, policies should be universal in principle paying attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized populations.</p>

                <li>On average—and taking into account population size—income inequality increased by 11 per cent in developing countries between 1990 and 2010</li>
                <li>A significant majority of households in developing countries—more than 75 per cent of the population—are living today in societies where income is more unequally distributed than it was in the 1990s</li>
                <li>Evidence shows that, beyond a certain threshold, inequality harms growth and poverty reduction, the quality of relations in the public and political spheres and individuals’ sense of fulfilment and self-worth</li>
                <li>There is nothing inevitable about growing income inequality; several countries have managed to contain or reduce income inequality while achieving strong growth performance</li>
                <li>Income inequality cannot be effectively tackled unless the underlying inequality of opportunities is addressed</li>
                <li>In a global survey conducted by UN Development Programme, policy makers from around the world acknowledged that inequality in their countries is generally high and potentially a threat to long-term social and economic development</li>
                <li>Evidence from developing countries shows that children in the poorest 20 per cent of the populations are still up to three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than children in the richest quintiles</li>
                <li>Social protection has been significantly extended globally, yet persons with disabilities are up to five times more likely than average to incur catastrophic health expenditures</li>
                <li>Despite overall declines in maternal mortality in the majority of developing countries, women in rural areas are still up to three times more likely to die while giving birth than women living in urban centres</li>
